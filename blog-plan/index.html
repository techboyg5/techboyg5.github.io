        <h1>Blog Plan</h1>
    <p>This is techboyg5's blog plan.</p>
    <h2>What I have tried before</h2>
    <p>About two months ago, I was thinking about creating my own blog. For three days, I had a blog written from scratch, but the downside was that whenever I added a new post to my blog or changed an existing one, I had to change every single page in the blog! As a result, I took down my blog three days after I created it.</p>
    <p>As a result, I would prefer <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. WordPress is free and open source software. With WordPress, changing a single thing is very easy. It is popular for blogging, and it has a lot of <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">themes</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugins</a>. I have been learning WordPress over the past month. Even though WordPress is free and open source software, you still have to pay for a hosting service.</p>
    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>I would recommend <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress/wordpress-hosting" target="_blank">Bluehost</a> for my blog hosting. It is popular for WordPress hosting, and has been <a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/" target="_blank">recommended by WordPress.org since 2005.</a></p>
    <p>Bluehost has three WordPress hosting plans. The Basic plan is perfect, and costs $2.95/month. With it, you get one website, 50 GB of storage and a free domain for 1 year.</p>
    <h2>Things I would post</h2>
    <p>I would post on my blog:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Things that I'm up to</li>
      <li>Things relating to my projects</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I won't use any personal information in my blog posts.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>I would use techboyg5blog.com. It is not owned by anyone.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I think that having my own blog would be a great idea.</p>
