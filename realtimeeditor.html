title: The Real-time HTML Editor is gone. But don't worry.
---
<p>The Real-time HTML Editor project has merged into the <a href="https://projects.techboyg5blog.com/web-development-tutorial/chapter1/page1.html">Web Development Tutorial</a>, and is now called the Code Editor.</p>
<p> On each of it's pages, you'll find a new "Code Editor" link which opens the new Code Editor.</p>
<h2>How is the Code Editor better than the Real-time HTML Editor?</h2>
<p>The Code Editor is better than the Real-time HTML Editor because it has seperate tabs for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is integrated right into the Web Development Tutorial.</p>
